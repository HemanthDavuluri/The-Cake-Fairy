      content="2020 was the year the tales of cake fairy started
from Kalyan Maharashtra . At the time of
pandemic as it was my best friends birthday and
everything was closed ,I decided to make home
made cake for her.
That day I realized that making cakes is an
fabulous feeling that I ever had. And to enjoy this
feeling I mastered the skill in different flavours of
cakes at home, which equally bought an
appreciation for my work and overwhelming
support from each of them. After working on my
skills to reach the perfection for a year and thus
having a magic touch for it,I started serving a
range of cakes.
In 2021 the doors are open now for selling variety
of cakes and gifts. As I want every one in the city
to taste the cakes prepared by The cake fairy with
love ."

      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
